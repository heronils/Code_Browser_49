* *user.cbs* – user scripts
* *user.cbc* – attaches names and keyboard shortcuts to user scripts. Each valid command will show up under the *Tools* menu entry.
* *user.cbc.backup* – a clone of *user.cbc*. Code Browser will overwrite *user.cbc* when you edit *Tools* -> *Options*, destroying the layout of that file. If that is not relevant for you, you can delete the *user.cbc.backup*.
